# TauREx version 2.6

TauREx (Tau Retrieval for Exoplanets) is a fully bayesian inverse atmospheric retrieval framework. 
TauREx is a very extensive retrieval framework with a wide range of functionalities. Here are installation instructions and worked examples whilst we write a more exhaustive manual.  
Already existing documentation can be found in the *Documentation* folder. 

For any questions on how to run the code, features and bugs, please email Ingo Waldmann (ingo@star.ucl.ac.uk).
